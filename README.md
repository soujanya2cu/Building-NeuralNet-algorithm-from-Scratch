# Building-NeuralNet-algorithm-from-Scratch

 ## Built the Neural Network Algorithm in BASE SAS without using any inbuilt SAS procedures:

As we all know Neural networks is a black box, here we tried to explain in detail how neural network algorithm works using SAS.

In this project, we used real dataset provided by a financial company. The company requested us to build an algorithm for Neural Network in Base SAS. This data contains  5000 observations and 500+ attributes. 

We developed code in SAS (Macros) to implement standard neural network with one hidden layer. Three separate macros were created for forward propagation, backward propagation and to control the iterations (epochs). In this model, we used sigmoid activation function to transform the input signal into an output signal and weights are adjusted with learning rate 0.1


## Applications and Benefits of My Algorithm
 1) The nuts and bolts of Neural Networks has been shown
 2) No such algorithm exist in Base SAS  so far using Macros
 3) This algorithm is beneficial for companies using Base SAS
 
 We are going to present this paper in SESUG 2018  St.Pete Beach, FL October 14-17 conference.
